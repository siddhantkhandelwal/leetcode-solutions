You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i<sup>th</sup>` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
Output: 6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 < prices.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `0 < prices[i], fee < 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>`


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int n = prices.size();
        int buy = INT_MIN;
        int sell = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            buy = max(buy, sell-prices[i]);
            sell = max(sell, buy+prices[i]-fee);
        }
        return sell;
    }
};
```
